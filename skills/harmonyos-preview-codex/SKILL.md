# HarmonyOS Preview in Codex

Use this workflow when the user asks to run or inspect a HarmonyOS project in a connected device, or asks to open HarmonyOS Preview in Codex.

## Required workflow

1. When the user asks to open the preview beside the conversation or in the right side panel, call `preview_panel` first. It is the thread entrypoint titled `鸿蒙真机预览`. Use `preview_open` for the left navigation/global app. Do not claim that either tool can force a pin state or persist the panel across chats or restarts.
2. Call `list_devices` and select one device ID. If no device is listed, report that HDC must be connected and authorized.
3. Call `preview_info` with the selected `deviceId` for a read-only connection check. Inspect `deviceCheck` and `runtime`; if it returns `restored: true`, reuse its `sessionId` and `previewUrl`.
4. Call `build_run` with the selected device ID when the app must be rebuilt or launched. It defaults to the `entry` module; for multi-module projects pass `moduleName`, and pass `artifactName` when that module emits multiple HAP files.
5. Call `preview_start` with the same device ID when no restorable session exists. Save the returned `sessionId` and `previewUrl`.
6. Open `previewUrl` with the Codex host browser-panel action at `placement: "right"` only as a live-preview fallback. The MCP App consumes `preview_frame(afterSeq)` for its live image; use `capture` when the next model decision needs an independent image.
7. Use `observe` for the current UITest tree and `find` with `selector` fields `text`, `textContains`, `id`, `type`, `clickable` or `enabled` to inspect candidates. For an authorized component click, call `tap_element` with that selector so the tool queries again and validates the current target. Keep coordinate `tap` for an authorized target confirmed from a fresh screenshot. After an action, use `wait_for` for expected state or text, then `capture` for fresh visual evidence.
8. Call `preview_stop` with the saved `sessionId` when the preview work is finished.

## Operating rules

- Do not call `preview_start` repeatedly for the same device; it reuses the active session.
- Keep the `sessionId` returned by `preview_start`; pass it to `preview_stop` so an older instruction cannot stop a newer session.
- `connected` from `preview_info` only means the live preview has received device frames. Check `deviceCheck.status` instead of treating `connected: false` as proof of an offline device. Without `deviceId`, the check is `not_checked`; with it, the check is `connected`, `disconnected` or `error`.
- Do not use coordinates from an old screenshot after navigation, scrolling, rotation or a new frame.
- `capture` always samples the device again, even during live preview. It returns `live: false`, a `frameId` and `capturedAt`; it does not prove an asynchronous page transition has finished.
- `preview_frame` is MCP App-only. It returns the newest in-memory frame by `seq`; repeated `afterSeq` values return no image and do not enter model content. Pass `waitMs` after an interaction to wait for the next frame instead of polling a stale sequence. Five seconds without frame requests pauses HDC polling; the next frame request resumes the same session.
- `preview_action` is MCP App-only for one pointer tap or swipe. It carries the current frame `seq` and refuses stale frames; model-facing `tap`, `swipe` and `tap_element` remain the semantic action tools.
- MCP requests may run concurrently; mutating operations for one device are queued in arrival order while reads and waits remain responsive. Send `$/cancelRequest` or `notifications/cancelled` with `params.requestId` to cancel a long wait, screenshot or HDC child process; expect JSON-RPC error `-32800`.
- `observe` defaults to 200 nodes; `find` defaults to 20 candidates. Conditions combine with AND, and matching multiple nodes never triggers an automatic click. Re-read after any navigation, scrolling or rotation.
- `tap_element` takes `deviceId`, the same AND `selector`, and optional `bundleName`. It queries a fresh tree with a two-candidate limit but checks the full match count. It clicks once only for a unique, clickable target that is not explicitly disabled or hidden, has valid bounds and center, and has a valid observation age of 0–1000 ms. Preflight rejection does not click or retry; HDC action failure may already have taken effect, so inspect new evidence before deciding what to do.
- `tap_element` success returns `action: "tap"`, `target`, `observedAt` and `verified: false`. It confirms command execution, not business completion; follow with `wait_for` and `capture`. It does not atomically eliminate UI changes between reading and tapping or make custom-rendered controls locatable.
- Empty or truncated trees and layout errors are not proof that a target is absent. Inspect the fresh screenshot fallback and its capture metadata. If `screenshotError` is present, inspect `screenshotDiagnostic` separately from the main error before acting.
- `wait_for` uses the same AND selector as `find`; `state` is `present` (default) or `absent`. `timeoutMs` is an integer from 1 to 30000 (default 5000), and `intervalMs` from 100 to 5000 (default 500). Optional `bundleName` scopes the layout. It observes only and never clicks.
- Wait for changed text with both its ID and the expected exact `text`, using `present`. `absent` requires a nonempty readable tree without matches; it cannot prove prior presence, custom-rendered content or business completion. Matching checks the full tree even though `lastObservation` retains at most 200 nodes and 20 matches, with totals and truncation flags.
- Inspect `status` (`matched`, `timeout`, `observation_failed`), `attempts`, `elapsedMs`, `lastObservation` and `warnings`. Failures include `error`, set `isError: true` and attempt a fresh screenshot. Screenshot capture has a 3-second budget, and each HDC cleanup has up to 2 seconds; final wait cleanup plus screenshot work can add about 7 seconds after the wait deadline. `elapsedMs` includes wait cleanup, not screenshot work. Preserve `screenshotError`; do not automatically repeat a failed action.
- Use the structured result fields (`deviceId`, `live`, `sessionId`, `connected`) instead of parsing text when available.
- When the Codex `open_in_codex` host action is available, pass `{ target: { type: "browser", url: previewUrl }, placement: "right" }` so the preview opens beside the conversation.
- `preview_open` adds the global sidebar entry, but the user must choose the entry's menu action to pin it the first time; there is no MCP API that can set the host's pin state.
- When the host opens a new page, call `preview_info` first and reopen its `previewUrl`; do not create a second session when `restored: true`.
- Ask before `build_run` if the user did not request a build or device state change.

## Minimal prompt pattern

```text
Run the HarmonyOS app, open its live preview, and tap the primary action button.
```

## 等待示例

用户已授权点击时，用 `tap_element` 查询并点击：`{"deviceId":"目标设备","selector":{"id":"submit","clickable":true}}`。成功结果的 `verified: false` 仍需验证；继续调用 `wait_for`：`{"deviceId":"目标设备","selector":{"id":"status","text":"完成"}}`，等待预期文字出现，再调用 `capture`。

加载控件消失可用 `{"deviceId":"目标设备","selector":{"id":"loading"},"state":"absent"}`。空树不算消失；当前树未匹配也不能替代业务结果确认。

## 连接与失败诊断

`preview_info({"deviceId":"目标设备"})` 只读检查 HDC 目标列表；不传设备时不探测。调用成功后仍需检查 `deviceCheck.status`，不能仅以没有 `isError` 判断设备在线。检查 `runtime.diagnosticsVersion`（当前为 `1`）及 `serverVersion`、`startedAt`、`instanceId`；同一次 MCP 服务启动期间的 `instanceId` 保持不变。缺少所需能力或运行契约时按 `MCP_OUTDATED` 处理，不据此判断设备离线，也不自动刷新宿主。

工具执行失败保留 `isError: true`、`error` 与结构化 `errorCode`、`stage`、`deviceId`、`elapsedMs`、`cause`。`DEVICE_OFFLINE` 需要目标列表确认；HDC 不可用或超时分别保留 `HDC_UNAVAILABLE`、`HDC_TIMEOUT`。等待超时可返回 `WAIT_TIMEOUT`；补图失败另记 `screenshotError`、`screenshotDiagnostic`，不能覆盖主错误或被用来自动重放点击、输入。

`tap_element` 的预检错误为 `ELEMENT_NOT_FOUND`、`ELEMENT_AMBIGUOUS`、`ELEMENT_NOT_ACTIONABLE` 或 `STALE_OBSERVATION`；保留其主错误与截图证据，不绕过检查自动改点候选或重试。新增工具需要宿主重新连接 MCP 后加载；已有只读验收通过时，仅确认新工具可见，不要求重复之前的只读验收。

`scripts/check-codex.mjs` 的 `connectionCheck` 标明检查范围：命令行为 `isolated_process`，传入客户端为 `provided_client`，两者均返回 `hostConnectionVerified: false`。独立验收通过不证明当前 Codex 对话已重连；宿主状态只能由当前对话实际调用工具验证。
